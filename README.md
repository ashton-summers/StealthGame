# StealthGame <br/>
This repository contains the implementation for a simple stealth game where the objective is to </br>
extract an objective and carry it to the extraction point. This project is written in C++ using the </br>
Unreal Engine 4 API and serves as a starting point and learning experience for video game development. </br>
The implementation of this project follows a Udemy course which can be found on Udemy.com at this link: </br>

My plan is to use this project as something to be extended on, to continue to challenge myself and learn. </br>
